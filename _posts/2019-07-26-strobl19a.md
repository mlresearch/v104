abstract: Many causal processes in biomedicine contain cycles and evolve. However,
  most causal discovery algorithms assume that the underlying causal process follows
  a single directed acyclic graph (DAG) that does not change over time. The algorithms
  can therefore infer erroneous causal relations with high confidence when run on
  real biomedical data. In this paper, I relax the single DAG assumption by modeling
  causal processes using a mixture of DAGs so that the graph can change over time.
  I then describe a causal discovery algorithm called Causal Inference over Mixtures
  (CIM) to infer causal structure from a mixture of DAGs using longitudinal data.
  CIM improves the accuracy of causal discovery on both real and synthetic clinical
  datasets even when cycles, non-stationarity, non-linearity, latent variables and
  selection bias exist simultaneously. Code is available at https://github.com/ericstrobl/CIM.
