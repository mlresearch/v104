abstract: The discovery of causal relationships from observations is a fundamental
  and difficult problem. We address it in the context of Additive Noise Models, and
  show, through both consistency analysis and experiments, that the state-of-art causal
  inference procedure on such models can be made simpler and faster, without loss
  of performance. Indeed, the method we propose uses one regressor instead of two
  in the bivariate case and 2(d − 1) regressors instead of (d^2 − 1) in the multivariate
  case with d random variables. In addition, we show how one can, from the regressors
  we use, accelerate the computation of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion,
  a standard independence measure used in several causal inference procedures.
