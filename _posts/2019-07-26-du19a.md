abstract: 'User retention is a key focus for consumer based internet companies and
  promotions are an effective lever to improve retention. However, companies rely
  either on non-causal churn prediction to capture heterogeneity or on regular A/B
  testing to capture average treatment effect. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous
  treatment effect optimization framework to capture both heterogeneity and causal
  effect. We propose two algorithms to maximize heterogeneous treatment effect: 1)
  Ranking based on point estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects obtained using
  existing esti- mation methods with training labels adjusted based on Lagrangian
  Subgradient method. 2) A novel ranking algorithm which combines estimation and optimization
  in one stage and directly optimizes for the aggregated targeted treatment effect.
  We also develop an evaluation metric that captures the real-world business value
  of different methods and use this to evaluate various approaches on our large-scale
  experiment data set both offline and online. Our algorithm (approach 2) performs
  significantly better than random explore benchmark and existing estimators (approach
  1) in both offline and online tests. This method has been deployed to production
  and is currently live in multiple cities all over the world.'
