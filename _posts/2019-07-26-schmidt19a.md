abstract: In the context of high-dimensional data state-of-the-art methods for constraint-based
  causal structure learning, such as the PC algorithm, are limited in their application
  through their worst case exponential computational complexity. To address the resulting
  long execution time, several parallel extensions have been developed to exploit
  modern multi-core systems. These extensions apply a static distribution of tasks
  to the execution units to achieve paral- lelism, which introduces the problem of
  load imbalance. In our work, we propose a parallel implementation that follows a
  dynamic task distribution in order to avoid situations of load imbalance and improve
  the execution time. On the basis of an experimental evaluation on real-world high
  dimensional datasets, we show that our implementation has a better load balancing
  compared to an existing parallel implementation in the context of multivariate normal
  distributed data. For datasets that introduce load imbalance, our dynamic task distribution
  approach outperforms existing static approaches by factors up to 2.4. Overall, we
  increase the speed up from factors of up to 27, for the static approach, to factors
  of up to 39 for the dynamic approach, when scaling to 80 cores compared to a non-parallel
  execution.
