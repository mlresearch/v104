abstract: In recent years, great strides have been made for causal structure learning
  in the high- dimensional setting and in the mixed data-type setting when there are
  both discrete and continuous variables. However, due to the complications involved
  with modeling continuous-discrete variable interactions, the intersection of these
  two settings has been relatively understudied. The current paper explores the problem
  of efficiently extending causal structure learning algorithms to high-dimensional
  data with mixed data-types. First, we characterize a model over continuous and discrete
  variables. Second, we derive a de- generate Gaussian (DG) score for mixed data-types
  and discuss its asymptotic properties. Lastly, we demonstrate the practicality of
  the DG score on learning causal structures from simulated data sets.
