abstract: A major driver in the success of predictive machine learning has been the
  “common task framework,” where community-wide benchmarks are shared for evaluating
  new algorithms. This pattern, however, is difficult to implement for causal learning
  tasks because the ground truth in these tasks is in general unobservable. Instead,
  causal inference methods are often evaluated on synthetic or semi-synthetic datasets
  that incorporate idiosyncratic assump- tions about the underlying data-generating
  process. These evaluations are often proposed in conjunction with new causal inference
  methods—as a result, many methods are eval- uated on incomparable benchmarks. To
  address this issue, we establish an API for gen- eralized causal inference model
  assessment, with the goal of developing a platform that lets researchers deploy
  and evaluate new model classes in instances where treatments are explicitly known.
  The API uses a common interface for each of its components, and it allows for new
  methods and datasets to be evaluated and saved for future benchmarking.
